    <title>Interactive Report: The Global AI Insurance Revolution</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Professional Calm -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an interactive dashboard. A fixed top navigation allows users to jump to key sections: Overview, Global Landscape, Regional Deep Dives, Key Themes, and Strategic Imperatives. This non-linear structure prioritizes user-led exploration over the report's original linear format. The Regional Deep Dive section uses interactive cards instead of a map for better responsiveness and clarity. Clicking a card dynamically displays detailed content with tabs for Market Overview, Applications, and Regulation, preventing information overload. This structure was chosen to make the dense report content digestible and engaging for executive-level users who need to find specific information quickly. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Data is presented using Chart.js for clarity and interactivity. Goals: Inform (Stat Cards for key metrics), Compare (Bar/Line charts for market trends/regional performance), Organize (Tabbed content for regional details, Accordions for challenges/strategies). Interactions: On-hover tooltips for charts, click-to-reveal for regional data and strategic details. Justification: These choices break down complex information into manageable chunks, promoting understanding and user engagement without requiring deep reading of the entire report. All visualizations use Canvas, adhering to the NO SVG/Mermaid constraint. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
